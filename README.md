  sale_time TIME,
  customer_id INT,
  gender VARCHAR(256),
  age INT,
  category VARCHAR(256),
  quantiy INT,
  price_per_unit FLOAT,
  cogs FLOAT,
  total_sale FLOAT
);
```

SELECT * FROM Retail_sales_table
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
  OR sale_date IS NULL
  OR sale_time IS NULL
  OR customer_id IS NULL 
  OR gender IS NULL
  OR age IS NULL
  OR category IS NULL
  OR quantiy IS NULL
  OR price_per_unit IS NULL
  OR cogs IS NULL
  OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM Retail_sales_table;
```

### 3. Distinct Categories

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM Retail_sales_table;
```

```

---

### Q3. Total sales by category

```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Retail_sales_table
GROUP BY category;
```

---

### Q4. Average age of customers in the Beauty category

SELECT * FROM Retail_sales_table
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```

---

### Q6. Transactions by gender in each category

```sql
SELECT gender, category, COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_transactions

### Q7. Monthly average sale and best-selling month in each year

```sql
SELECT YEAR(sale_date) AS Year,
       MONTH(sale_date) AS Month,
       ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS Avg_sale
FROM Retail_sales_table
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date)
ORDER BY Year, Month;
```

---

### Q8. Top 5 highest-paying customers

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS Total_sale
FROM Retail_sales_table
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY Total_sale DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### Q9. Unique customers per category

```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
